## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to convey expertise and depth. Hex code based on perceived values in HSL.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), a desaturated form of the primary color, for a clean and professional backdrop. Hex code based on perceived values in HSL.
- Accent color: Vibrant blue (#03A9F4), an analogous hue, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. Hex code based on perceived values in HSL.
- Body: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif font, offering a modern and slightly warm feel suitable for blocks of text.
- Headings: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, for a contemporary and slightly techy style.
- Use Font Awesome icons to represent categories and actions throughout the app. Given that font-awesome icons are already being used by the source code in the prompt, and are available via a CDN, continue their use.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout that makes it easy for users to find the information they need. The current design follows this approach well, so it can be continued with minimal change.
- Subtle animations to create a more engaging experience. Maintain or expand upon the transitions in the source code from the prompt.
